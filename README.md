# The-Way-Unraveled
Portfolio and code laboratory
The plan is for this website to start as my portfolio, but maybe turn into something more. It'll be a relatively small website, but it's packed with demonstraions of what I've learned and what I can do. It looks and functions best in firefox. For some reason, a couple of my javascript functions designed to change the style of the welcome page don't want to work in chrome or ie, but I don't think that's a deal breaker. Though I'll keep working on it.

I probably don't need to tell anyone who will see this how to set these files up, but for the sake of thoroughness, I'll lay it all out. All of the html files go in the main folder. All the external style sheets go in a sub folder titled css. All of the external scripts go in a sub folder titled js. The audio files go in a sub folder titled audio. And the images go in a sub folder titled img. The img folder has two sub folders, one titled backgrounds for all the background images and the background button images, and another folder titled social_icons for the custom social media buttons.

Hope you like it. I'm very proud of this one. :)
