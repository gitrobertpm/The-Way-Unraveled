# The-Way-Unraveled
Portfolio and code laboratory
The plan is for this website to start as my portfolio, but maybe turn into something more. It'll be a relatively small website, at least at first, but it's packed with stylish demonstraions of what I've learned and what I can do. It still looks and functions best in firefox, but I've finding the kinks and working them out so that it's almost perfect in other modern brpwsers as well.

Hope you like it. I'm very proud of this one. :)
