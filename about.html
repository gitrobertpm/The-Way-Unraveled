				<h3 class="subTitle">PURPOSE</h3>
				<p>As admitted in the Mission Statement on the welcome page, for now, this site is more portfolio and code laboratory than anything else.  But the hope is that in time, all that will change and thewayunraveled.com will evolve into something that might be able to make a difference in a fast-paced world with an uncertain future.</p>
				<h3 class="subTitle">PROMISE</h3>
				<p>As I build and code, I pledge to make an honest attempt to come up with truly beneficial creations.  Through helpful anecdotes, essays, programs, and other miscellaneous inspirational content, I will try to share with the world, the best of the things I've learned, the best of the things that life has taught me.</p>
				<p>I've crammed a <i>helluva</i> lot of life into the last couple decades.  It's been an incredible and widespread journey across the landscape of reality and the many dimensions of the mind.  Life's surprisingly winding road has taken many sharp and strange turns.  Along the way, I've discovered a few things that could be of great value to some.  So, I'll do my best to politely share with you what I can.</p>

				<p>Let's keep it nice and simple</p>

And unfortunately, until people stop ripping each other off or being otherwise despicable, we will all have a need to protect ourselves in such lame ways.  Cheers.</p>

				<h3 class="subTitle">TITLE</h3>
				<p>The title of this site is what the books might call a triple-entendre, which is just a fancy way of saying that it has three different meanings.</p>
				<p>Firstly, the title of this site could be interpreted as a revealing of something that had been previously hidden, as in the <b>unravelling</b> of the <b>way</b>.</p>
				<p>Secondly, it could refer to what happens when one loses their way, as in their <b>way</b> completely <b>unraveled</b>.</p>
				<p>And finally, the title could be describing such things that are on the edgy fringes of life where the very cohesion or raveling of things is tenuous, where things are far out, where things are <b>way unraveled</b>.</p>
				<p>Conveniently, each of these three meanings nicely conveys what I would like this site to be all about:</p>
				<p>A revealing of the important things,</p>
				<p>assistance for those whom things are falling apart, or unravelling,</p>
				<p>and an exploration of the deepest deep, the truest true, the farthest out, and those things that are way unraveled.&#9775;</p>

					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<div class="triangle-l"></div>
					<div class="triangle-r"></div>
				</div>
				<p>I am just another one of the faceless masses, just another nobody member of the blessed proletariat.</p>
				<p>Beyond that, and more specifically, I have attended fourteen different schools, but have nothing better than a GED to show for it.  Though that's not to say that I am uneducated.</p>
				<p>I've been the lucky recipient of pay&dash;checks from nearly fifty different jobs spanning nearly three decades and an interesting variety of industries, but I have no real career to show for it.</p>
				<p>I've lived in three different states, more than a dozen cities, and too many residences to recall, ranging from your up&dash;scale Cali' suburban two&dash;story with the classic kidney shaped pool, to apartments, 'plexes, motels, rooms for rent, and even the front seat of some old Honda, but I still don't have a home of my own to show for it.</p>
				<p>I've met maybe hundreds of acquaintances and have had dozens of close personal relationships with all sorts and types, and I've studied each one to a fine detail.</p>
				<p>I've crossed lines, tested limits, challenged authority, questioned everything, and through it all, each step of the way, I have closely inspected the textural dimensions of the mind, reality, and the human experience.</p>
				<p>I've been down and out, beaten up, broken hearted, at death's door, in and out of trouble, addicted, written off, and subject to monumental amounts of suffering, but I rose from those ashes to take a stand, to try to do the right thing, to try to be a good spouse, and a good father to three wonderful, pain&dash;in&dash;the&dash;ass kids, who disrupt the days, enrich our lives, and are growing up way too fast.</p>
				<p>And through all that, I have read, and researched, and studied the theories and the concepts.  I have learned a few things about life, things that might be of help, and I'm trying to get as much of it written down here, for you, before my fuse burns up for good.&#9775;</p>

					<h2>What's with all the yin yangs</h2>
					<div class="triangle-l"></div>
					<div class="triangle-r"></div>
				</div>
				<p>Yeah, I get it.  There's a lot of them, right?</p>
				<p>Why so many?</p>
				<p>Well, firstly and mainly, I just really enjoy the image.  Besides being aesthetically pleasing, in my opinion the yin yang captures the very essence of reality better than any other symbol.  It perfectly conveys the interaction and intermingling of polar opposites, through which all movement in the universe is made possible, and in the center of which, it appears balance and harmony may be achieved.  How cool is that?</p>
				<p>Secondly, apart from being totally awesome, the yin yang is public domain, and therefore equally accessible by all.&#9775;</p>
